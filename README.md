# bench-utils

A small repo containing code for different generic utils which can be used to benchmark existing code\
or construct microbenchmarks.

Current the code only compiles on Apple Silicon (aarch64). Can be easily extending by implementing the\
methods in `platform_utils.cpp` for other CPUs/OSes.
